# Web Scraping Project
This repo contains my web scraping project to extract property rental data from a property classified website. For beginners, web scraping is a term used to describe the use of a program or algorithm to extract and process large amounts of data from the web. Whether you are a data scientist, web developer, or anybody who analyzes large amounts of datasets, the ability to scrape data from the web is a useful skill to have. Consider the scenario that you found some data from the web that you would like to work on it, but there is no direct way to download it, web scraping is a skill you can use to extract the data and save it into a useful form that can be analyzed later.

## BeautifulSoup
This project uses Python, urllib and Beautiful Soup. The urllib.request module is used to open URLs. The Beautiful Soup is a Python library for extracting data out of HTML and XML files. We can use the BeautifulSoup library to parse document, and extract the text from tags.

## CSV Output
In this project, we save the extracted data into a CSV file. Comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. After that, we can use Python Pandas library to load and analyze the data.

## CAUTION
As a word of CAUTION, web scraping sometimes breaks a company terms of use, and could get you in trouble with the law, thus you should be careful about which sites you scrape. This repo mainly serves as my personal portfolio and for educational purpose for general public only. Feel free to contact me if you have any queries.
